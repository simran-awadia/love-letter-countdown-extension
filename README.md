# Love Letter Countdown Google Chrome Extension

## What does it do? 
It allows you to see how many cards are left for each character in the strategy game Love Letter on Board Game Arena.
The extension works for the regular and the expansion (more than 4 players) version.
The counts will automatically reset at the end of every round.

## How to use it?
1. Clone the repo
1. Go to chrome://extensions/ 
1. Turn on Developer mode, click `Load unpacked` and select the `love-letter-countdown-extension` folder 
1. Turn the extension on 
1. The extension should now be visible as the letter `C`
1. Start a new game or go to an existing game and click on the extension for an alert that will show you how many cards of each character are left

## Possible Improvements 
1. Use an image of the deck as the icon instead of a `C`
1. Specify the game table URL in the manifest
1. Make the information appear on a popup page instead of a simple alert

## Background
My colleagues and I tend to play the expansion version of this game, which means there are 17 characters to keep track of!
The extension allows you to make informed guesses for what card someone else has. This is useful, especially towards the end of the game and for Guard attacks in general.
